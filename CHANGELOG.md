# Changelog

All notable changes to Riprap. The hackathon submission tag is
`v0.5.0` (build 2026-05-07); subsequent dates record polish work
that landed on the hackathon-period production deploys.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-17 (Sunday, rebrand + BYOD + PDF route)

### Added — rebrand surface (Claude Design handoff)
- **New positioning copy across the marketing surface.** Hero H1 cycles
  through "A climate-exposure briefing for {New York City | Chicago |
  Seattle | San Francisco | Boston}." in federal-blue italic; deck
  names the four primary source families (FEMA / NOAA / USGS / city
  open data) so the trust-strip claim is foreshadowed inline. Browser
  title + meta description rewritten for any-US-place framing.
- **Dynamic header chip.** `/api/deployment` returns active deployment
  `{name, city, hazard}` from `stones.yaml`'s optional new
  `deployment:` block (with sensible deployment-dir-name fallback —
  `nyc → NYC`, `sf → SF`, `heat → NYC + "Heat-exposure briefing"`,
  etc.). `AppHeader` reads it through a Svelte 5 store; chip pill
  swaps as you change `RIPRAP_DEPLOYMENT`.
- **Six new trust components** (per civic-tech compliance registers
  USWDS · GOV.UK Design System · Section 508 · WCAG 2.2 AA · Plain
  Writing Act 2010):
  - `PhaseBanner.svelte` — open-beta banner, GOV.UK pattern
  - `UseBand.svelte` — responsible-use disclaimer + non-affiliation
  - `SourceStrip.svelte` — trust-signal counts (23 · 9 · 5 · 3)
  - `StandardsStrip.svelte` — compliance badges
  - `CityPicker.svelte` — five-city pill row, jumps to canonical
    anchor addresses that probe_cities.py exercises in CI
  - `SkipLink.svelte` — USWDS-canonical "Skip to main content"
- **BYOD client-side dialog** (`ByodDialog.svelte` + `client/byod.ts`
  + `stores/byodRegistry.svelte.ts`). Three-section workflow: file
  drop → adapter auto-detection → pebble mapping. Files stay on the
  user's machine; manifest persisted to IndexedDB via idb-keyval.
  Parsers: PapaParse for CSV, native JSON for `.json` / `.geojson`,
  js-yaml for `.yaml` / `.yml`.
- **Server-side PDF route** at `/api/print` via WeasyPrint
  (`app/print_pdf.py`). POST briefing JSON, get back a tagged PDF
  with cover · briefing · citations · verification stamp. SHA-256
  document hash on the stamp page lets two reviewers verify
  bit-for-bit equivalence. The header "export PDF" button now POSTs
  the cached `PrintSnapshot` from localStorage and opens the PDF in
  a new tab via a blob URL (replacing the legacy
  `/print/<queryId>` print-stylesheet path).

### Changed
- **Deleted `LandPreview.svelte`** — its "Briefing excerpt" pane
  carried synthetic numbers ("1% AE flood zone", "4.7 ft Sandy HWM",
  "14 nuisance floods since 2023") dressed in real-looking citation
  chrome on a page whose standards strip badges `✓ Plain Writing Act`.
  Removed. `LandStones` below is the structural explainer for "what
  you'll get back" and contains no fabricated data.
- **`LandStones` taglines** rewritten hazard- and city-agnostic
  (was NYC-specific: "what NYC's ground remembers", "MTA · NYCHA
  · DOE · DOH · PLUTO"; now: "what the ground remembers", "Transit
  entrances · public housing · schools · hospitals · whatever asset
  registers a jurisdiction publishes").
- **Provenance correctness fixes.** `floodnet.yaml` license
  `CC-BY-NC-4.0` → `CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0` (ShareAlike was missing; FloodNet
  data terms require it). `npcc4_slr.yaml` license
  `NYC Open Data Terms of Use` → `CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Annals of the New
  York Academy of Sciences)` with parent DOI `10.1111/nyas.15116` in
  the citation string.
- **AppFooter disclaimer reworded** from "does not predict damage"
  to "is a reference dossier, not a stamped engineering memo, risk
  score, or disclosure." Lists explicit out-of-scope uses (real-estate
  transactions, mortgage / insurance, personal property decisions).
- README adds a **"What this is. What this isn't."** block naming the
  user types Riprap is for (resilience consultants, ASTM E1527-21 BER
  addenda preparers, journalists, agency analysts) and explicitly NOT
  for (drainage / hydraulic design, residents — defer to FloodHelpNY,
  mortgage / insurance underwriting, real-estate transactions).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-16 (Saturday, post-hackathon OSS polish)

### Added
- **Five-city framework generalisation.** NYC is now the reference
  deployment; four new deployments ship alongside it on the same code:
  - `deployments/chicago/` — Socrata 311 (`v6vf-nfxy`), NOAA Calumet Harbor 9087044
  - `deployments/seattle/` — federal pebbles only (Seattle CSR lacks point geometry)
  - `deployments/sf/` — DataSF 311 (`vw6y-z8j6`, `point` field), NOAA SF Bay
  - `deployments/boston/` — Analyze Boston 311 via CKAN, NOAA Boston Harbor 8443970
- **`ckan_records` adapter** (`riprap/core/pebbles/adapters/ckan_records.py`)
  — bbox SQL push-down + haversine refine, since CKAN datasets usually
  ship lat/lon as numeric columns rather than a geometry-typed field.
  Unlocks Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, EU portals.
- **BYOD load paths.** `load_registry` now merges manifests from
  `${CWD}/.riprap/` and from `RIPRAP_EXTRA_MANIFESTS` (colon-separated
  paths). Relative paths in BYOD manifests resolve against the
  manifest's own directory, so a user can ship a manifest + data file
  side-by-side anywhere on disk. Worked example in `examples/byod/`
  using real FDNY firehouses data (NYC Open Data `hc8x-tcnd`, 219
  records). Full walkthrough in `docs/byod.md`.
- **`scripts/probe_cities.py`** — 5-deployment sweep, runs in ~110 s
  against real upstream APIs, asserts 13/13 compliance per city.
  Reproducible regression check.
- **`docs/multi-city.md`, `docs/byod.md`, `docs/VERIFICATION.md`,
  `docs/PORT-YOUR-CITY.md`** — open-source onboarding surface.
- **`tests/test_byod_load.py`** — 7 tests covering both load paths,
  manifest-dir path resolution, cross-deployment portability, and
  override warnings.

### Changed
- `web/main.py:_run_compare` — fixed B023 loop-variable closure capture
  in the per-target trace wrapper (`_TaggedQ` now binds via `__init__`
  params, not closure). Latent footgun made deterministic.
- `tests/test_stone_envelope.py::test_step_to_stone_mapping_covers_known_steps`
  — was grep-based on `web/main.py` source; the pebble refactor moved
  `_STEP_TO_STONE` to a runtime dict comp. Test now asserts against the
  imported runtime dict.
- README banner re-pitched for OSS: framework, not just NYC.
- CONTRIBUTING re-framed from "hackathon submission" to "civic-tech
  framework that began as a hackathon project."
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/port_to_new_city.yml` — refreshed to cite
  the 5 existing deployments + Socrata/CKAN adapters as starting points.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-09 (Saturday)

### Added
- **Per-query inference energy ledger** with real NVML readings off
  the L4 GPU. The status row on the Findings region now reports
  total Wh + total tokens for every briefing, with a leading icon
  (`✓` / `◐` / `~`) disclosing whether the number was measured or
  estimated. Full breakdown documented in
  [`docs/EMISSIONS.md`](docs/EMISSIONS.md).
- `inference-vllm/proxy.py`: 100 ms-cadence NVML sampler, response
  headers `X-GPU-Power-W` / `X-GPU-Energy-J` on every forwarded
  POST, and a `GET /v1/power` endpoint for bracket-sampling clients.
- `app/emissions.py` — new module with a thread-local `Tracker` that
  records every LLM and ML inference call (model, hardware, tokens,
  duration, joules) with a `measured: bool` flag per row.
- `scripts/probe_stones_fire.py` — programmatic CI that runs an
  address query against the lablab UI and asserts all five Stones
  fire, no `torchvision::nms` / `deps unavailable` dep regression,
  and the `emissions` block carries `nvidia_l4` hardware.
- `scripts/probe_benchmarks.py` — collects the canonical
  four-address verification set into `outputs/benchmarks.json`
  for the `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` page.
- `docs/EMISSIONS.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Changed
- The `RunHealthStrip` chip dropped the cloud-energy comparison
  (the sign convention was misleading and the comparison is now
  redundant given real measurements). New format:
  `<icon> X.X Wh / Y.YK tok inference`.
- `app/llm.py:_default_hardware_label` defaults to `"NVIDIA L4"`
  when remote vLLM is configured (was `"AMD MI300X"`, a stale
  string from the droplet days).
- `app/llm.py:chat()` now brackets every completion with two GETs
  to the inference Space's `/v1/power` endpoint; the average powers
  the LLM-call energy reading instead of the data-sheet estimate.
- `app/inference.py:_post()` reads NVML headers off the proxy
  response and forwards real joules into `emissions.record_ml`.

### Fixed
- `app/flood_layers/prithvi_live.py`: when the configured remote
  inference call fails (`RemoteUnreachable`), the specialist no
  longer falls through to the local terratorch path. The local
  path crashes with `RuntimeError: operator torchvision::nms does
  not exist` on the cpu-basic UI Space; surfacing a clean
  `remote prithvi-pluvial unreachable` skip is correct.
- `app/context/terramind_nyc.py:_try_remote()`: returns a
  `{"ok": False, "skipped": "remote terramind/<adapter>: ..."}`
  sentinel on remote failure, instead of `None` which was
  silently masked as `deps unavailable on this deployment`.
- `web/main.py`: explicit `/favicon.svg`, `/favicon.png`,
  `/favicon.ico`, `/robots.txt` routes — they were 404-ing under
  the SvelteKit SPA fallback because only `/_app` was mounted off
  the build directory.

### Documentation
- Full README rewrite reflecting the post-droplet L4 topology, the
  new emissions feature, and updated repo structure. Hackathon
  framing preserved.
- New `docs/DEPLOY.md` with the production topology, env-var
  reference, and per-Space deploy commands.
- New `docs/EMISSIONS.md` documenting what's measured vs. estimated,
  the NVML pipeline, and how to verify.

### Infrastructure note
- The DigitalOcean MI300X droplet was decommissioned 2026-05-06.
  All production inference now serves from `msradam/riprap-vllm`
  (NVIDIA L4). The MI300X runbook is preserved in
  [`docs/DROPLET-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/DROPLET-RUNBOOK.md) for anyone
  reproducing the AMD-judging setup; setting
  `RIPRAP_HARDWARE_LABEL=AMD MI300X` swaps the emissions profile
  back when redeploying to that hardware.
